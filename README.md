# Optimizing_NLP_Models_with_Metaheuristic_Techniques
Optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs) and machine learning (ML) models for natural language processing (NLP) remains a significant challenge due to their high computational requirements and intricate structures. This paper explores the role of metaheuristic techniques in strengthening the efficiency of NLP models through parameter pruning. Metaheuristics such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Swarm Intelligence (SI), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Migrating Bird Optimization (MBO) have demonstrated substantial improvements in optimizing hyperparameters, feature selection, and overall performance of the model. We explore recent developments where combined strategies, such as GA integrated with auto-encoders, have notably advanced feature extraction in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Furthermore, we assess how multi-population PSO (MPPSO) boosts the flexibility of NLP models in software defect identification, utilizing approaches like TF-IDF and BERT. Despite these advancements, challenges such as dataset limitations, dependency on preprocessing, and variability in metaheuristic optimization persist. Further research should focus on integrating deep learning architectures like transformers and generative adversarial networks (GANs) with metaheuristic-driven pruning strategies to enhance efficiency, adaptability, and scalability in NLP applications.
